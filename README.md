# A Self learning Flappy bird

In this game the flappy birds learn on their own to score maximum. 
The game uses an AI model(a python package called neat-python) to learn from the positive feedback(if a bird scores better than other) and then generates a new generation of better and evolved birds. And this process of learning and evolution contibues.
